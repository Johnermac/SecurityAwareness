Hi, I've written a document to raise awareness in such topics: Passwords, Wi-Fi, Home office, Social Media, and Safe Web Browsing. 


Introduction:


Research suggests that human error is present in 90% of information leakage cases. This guide aims to raise awareness among your employees and consequently reduce the risk of data losses, information leaks, penalties, business and resource losses, and, especially, the risk of damage to the companyâ€™s image and reputation.

The issues presented in this guide address common errors observed in the daily activities of employees in any company, such as those related to email access, internet browsing, improper use of external devices, among others. Therefore, we have included mandatory rules in this document that must be followed by all employees working with company equipment and/or in their digital environments, as well as recommendations for best practices to enhance the security of our technological environment. We will continuously monitor compliance with the rules and recommendations presented here.
